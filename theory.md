# Metabolic Disorders and Public Health

Suppose one were interested in answering a singular question in order to generate the greatest possible impact on public health, for instance, public health in the United States.

It would make sense to begin with a question that both highly specialized researchers and completely ordinary people ask with near constant frequency, sincerity, and intensity:

***What will happen to my body if I eat this?***

The quest to understand the impact of food on the body ranges from the origins of medicine in the Hellenistic world (Hippocrates, "Let food be thy medicine") to the most contemporary double-blind placebo-controlled randomized longitudinal trials.

If one were to begin an ideologically unmotivated search for the root of the world's most pernicious and pervasive chronic illnesses such as heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes, one would quickly discover a common link which is thoroughly documented in the peer-reviewed literature:

## Systemic Chronic Inflammation (SCI)

SCI is a condition wherein the body consistently mobilizes immune resources to target non-infective, self-identified damaged tissues.

Tissues and cells are commonly damaged by the presence of high levels of reactive-oxygen species (ROSs) complemented by a dearth of anti-inflammatory compounds and antioxidants.

Examples of this include the targeting of proteins in the bloodstream by immune cells that have been damaged by persistent high blood sugar conditions through a process known as glycation.

According to the authors of a Nature Perspectives article on the subject, SCI is an underlying link that "Lead(s) to several diseases that collectively represent the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide, such as **cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders**." [^1]

In the very same article, the authors point out that chronic inflammatory diseases cause more than half of all deaths worldwide.
 
## The Metabolic Link

In conjunction with SCI, metabolic dysfunction presenting clinically as metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, or diabetes is a powerful contributor to all-cause mortality.

In a study analyzing a large cohort in the Framingham Heart Study, researchers discovered that simple physiological measurements such as blood pressure and BMI in younger cohorts, and fasting blood glucose in older cohorts were predictive of all-cause mortality. [^2] 

Metabolic dysfunction and SCI are intimately linked and share many mechanisms of action.

**Together, they represent a vicious feedback loop where greater inflammation promotes fat storage and inhibits anabolism while fatty tissue releases cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha that continue the inflammatory cascade that promoted obesity to begin with.** [^3]

This relationship is understood in such a way that SCI is a known symptom of metabolic disorder and SCI is simultaneously an important contributing factor in the development of metabolic syndrome.[^4]

## The Biggest Levers

To turn from the descriptive to the prescriptive, it is clear that in order to impact clinical outcomes, key risk factors for chronic and/or inflammatory diseases must be mitigated.

In this case, the vicious cycle of SCI and metabolic dysfunction must be broken.

Surprisingly, the best method for achieving this is as well understood as it is a non-starter for healthcare: diet and exercise.

The results of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a massive study undertaken by the NIH over the course of 5 years and published in 2002 **clearly indicated that intensive lifestyle coaching was superior to pharmaceutical standard-of-care (Metformin) in reversing type 2 diabetes.** [^5]

The authors of the DPP study attributed the reversal to a reduction in BMI (weight-loss), and weight-loss was presented to the experimental group as the key outcome in which diet and exercise were the methods.

## The Skinny on Losing Weight

So, to the surprise of perhaps no one: The largest lever that can be pulled in the world of public health is a promotion of diet and exercise as intentional lifestyle changes designed to break the vicious cycle of SCI and metabolic dysfunction.

The question then arises naturally enough: *What can be done to enhance the process of weight-loss?*,

Taking the DPP as a model, weight-loss can be achieved through diet and exercise. Let's break them apart for analysis:

### Diet

The proliferation of dietary advice and expertise into the mainstream appears to be decoupled from health outcomes. Obesity rates continue to increase as information and dietary prescriptions abound.

Recent research has indicated that this decoupling is driven by the near boundless complexity of, and variation between individual metabolic profiles, with greater than 100% variation in glucose response owing to individual genetics, microbiome composition, insulin levels, food allergies, and more. [^6]

While large patterns are possible to identify *(Oreos spike everyone's blood sugar...)* a food with a low glycemic index for some may have a high glycemic index for others.

Drawing from the basal diabetic hypothesis that blood sugar spikes lead to insulin overrelease which leads to promotion of adipose tissue (fat) and insulin resistance (together, metabolic syndrome) it becomes clear that **the main KPI in a dietary regimen is the minimization of blood glucose variability.**

### Exercise

Commenting on the level, type, or frequency of exercise optimal for weight loss is beyond the scope of this document, although two points can be established quickly:

First, regardless of the exercise an individual engages in, total weight loss is higher when their baseline activity level (defined as steps taken per day) is higher[^7], making incentives for movement critical in weight loss.

Secondly, as regards the type of exercise and individual engages in for weight loss purposes, carefully controlled studies have indicated that **aerobic exercise** (defined as 60-70% of maximum heart rate or, low-intensity long-duration) led to significantly better markers of cardiovascular health as well as greater weight loss than anaerobic (high-intensity, short-duration) exercise. [^8]

From this we can derive a general prescription: **high(er) levels of baseline activity coupled with higher levels of aerobic exercise.**

### Summary of Weight-Loss Strategy

From this necessarily concise analysis we can promote a general prescription for non-pharmaceutical and non-surgical weight-loss:

*First, consume a diet that minimizes spikes and dips in blood sugar and is low in known pro-inflammatory or allergenic ingredients*.

*Second, engage in consistent aerobic exercise and elevate daily activity through regular motion or walking*.

## The Problem, The Technology, The Thesis (Where Am I Going With All This?)

### The Problem

Operating on the prescription outlined above, we are immediately confronted with problems of measurement:

*First, consume a diet that minimizes spikes and dips in blood sugar and is low in known pro-inflammatory or allergenic ingredients*.

How are we to measure blood sugar reliably? If we are able to generate data how can we reliably move that data into the cloud and once there, how can it be analyzed for actionable insights?

*Second, engage in consistent aerobic exercise and elevate daily activity through regular motion or walking*.

Once again, we are confronted by a measurement problem. Lacking perhaps iron willpower and a titanium schedule, how are we to know whether aerobic activity levels are increasing on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis? How many steps are we taking each day and are we on target? 

Can we be presented with **motivating, representative data** that tells us for instance, the integral of the heart-rate curve week to week, with an eye towards small, consistent increases?

Finally, if our goal is to track weight-loss over time, do we have tools and behaviors in place to actually track changes in weight accurately and consistently over time?

### The Technology

**Continuous Glucose Monitors** (CGMs) are familiar to those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes but are becoming more and more common among athletes and individuals pursuing weight-loss.

These monitors have evolved to the point where they are compatible with smartphones through Bluetooth, and are therefore able to **pipe data into the cloud** where it can be analyzed for patterns.

It is then conceivable that either in real-time or on a predictive basis, push notifications can be sent to the user with an eye toward informing or directing behavior.

Similarly, the market for wearables such as the now near-ubiqitous Apple Watch as well as Android equivalents have exploded and it is clear that users are willing to purchase and use these devices every day.

Furthermore, the Apple Watch has been used in myriad studies on population health and by HMOs for outpatient cardiac monitoring. Research into these wearables seems to reveal new biomarkers nearly every day. 

Germane to our purposes, **these wearables can provide accurate or at least representative data on baseline activity and aerobic fitness and volume of exercise, enabling the prediction of potential weight-loss.**

Finally, smart scales that can measure BMI over time have become cheap and compatible with major health management suites such as Apple Health and Samsung Health.

*Together, the CGM, the wearable, and the smart scale provide a cluster of sensors that can provide the relevant data needed to make informed health decisions, and in my opinion, deserve to become near-ubiqitous in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of metabolic diseases.*

### The Thesis

At the present moment, we seem to be at the convergence of three forces:

*An upward trend in obesity, SCI, and metabolic syndrome with disastrous financial and public health consequences.*

*An inevitable consumer and enterprise adoption of the marriage between wearable/domestic sensors and data science.*

*An emerging corpus of scientific research indicating both actionable general patterns for reversal of metabolic disease as well as an indication of the necessity of precision medicine and precision diet.*

So what does this all add up to?

**Hopefully it adds up to a movement that I would like to be a part of, namely, leveraging the combination of technology, research, entrepreneurial spirit, and goodwill to set about finding an end to the most prevalent and *eminently treatable* disease of civilization.**

It is my hope that beneficent governments around the world will be interested in offering a technology of this sort at low or no-cost to their population for their participation on a purely voluntary basis.
