# To-Do (Thursday March 31st 2022)

1. Finish implementing predict().
2. Pickle and dump the model.
3. Create app.py which stands up a simple Flask API (command-line) using the pickle.


# If you have time...
1. Implement an ensemble using:
* KNN
* XGBoost
2. Build an actual HTML frontend for Flask allowing you to run predict() on custom data.
3. Cry many salty tears.
